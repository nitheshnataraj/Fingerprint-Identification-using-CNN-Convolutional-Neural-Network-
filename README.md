# Fingerprint-Identification-using-DIP
Welcome to "Fingerprint Identification Using DIP" project! This project aims to develop a system for fingerprint identification using digital image processing techniques. Fingerprint identification is a crucial task in biometric security systems, and digital image processing offers efficient methods for extracting features and minutiae from fingerprint images for identification purposes.

# Introduction
Fingerprint identification is a biometric identification method that utilizes the unique patterns present in an individual's fingerprints. This project focuses on using digital image processing techniques to extract features from fingerprint images and perform identification tasks efficiently.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of fingerprint images collected from various sources. Due to privacy concerns, we cannot provide the dataset directly with this repository. However, you can use publicly available fingerprint datasets or collect your own dataset for experimentation.

# Steps Involved in Fingerprint Identification
Step 1: Fingerprint segmentation

Step 2: Estimation of local ridge orientation

Step 3: Estimation of local ridge frequency

Step 4: Fingerprint enhancement

Step 5: Detection of minutiae positions

Step 6: Estimation of minutiae directions

Step 7: Creation of local structures

Step 8: Fingerprint comparison

# Result
After the two different fingerprints are compared, a comparison score is displayed.
If the comparison score is less than 0.82, We can conclude that the fingerprint image inserted is not matched with the other fingerprint.
